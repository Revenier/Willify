                        You know I want you<br>
                        It's not a secret I try to hide<br>
                        You know you want me<br>
                        So don't keep saying our hands are tied<br>
                        You claim it's not in the cards<br>
                        And faith is pulling you miles away<br>
                        And out of a reach from me<br>
                        But you're hearing my heart<br>
                        So who can stop me if I decide it's on my destiny?<br><br>
                        What if we rewrite the stars?<br>
                        Say you were made to be mine<br>
                        Nothing could keep us apart<br>
                        You'll be the one I was meant to find<br>
                        It's up to you and it's up to me<br>
                        No one could say what we get to be<br>
                        So why don't we rewrite the stars?<br>
                        And maybe the world could be ours tonight<br><br>
                        You think it's easy<br>
                        You think I don't wanna grow onto you, yeah<br>
                        But there are mountains (but there are mountains)<br>
                        And there are doors that we can't walk through<br>
                        I know you're wondering why<br>
                        Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls<br>
                        But when we go outside you're gonna wake up<br>
                        And see that it was hopeless after all<br><br>
                        No one can rewrite the stars<br>
                        How can you say you'll be mine?<br>
                        Everything keeps us apart<br>
                        And I'm not the one you were meant to find<br>
                        (the one you were meant to find)<br>
                        It's not up to you, it's not up to me<br>
                        When everyone tells us what we can be<br>
                        And how come we rewrite the stars?<br>
                        Say that the world can be ours tonight<br><br>
                        All I want is to fly with you<br>
                        All I want is to fall with you<br>
                        So just give me all of you<br>
                        It feels impossible (it's not impossible)<br>
                        Is it impossible? (Say that it's possible)<br><br>
                        And how do we rewrite the stars?<br>
                        Say you were made to be mine<br>
                        And nothing could keep us apart<br>
                        'Cause you are the one I was meant to find<br>
                        It's up to you, and it's up to me<br>
                        No one could say what we get to be<br>
                        And why don't we rewrite the stars?<br>
                        Changing the world to be ours<br><br>
                        You know I want you<br>
                        It's not a secret I try to hide<br>
                        But I can't have you<br>
                        We're bound to break and my hands are tied<br>
